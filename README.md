# Lendsqr Frontend Engineer Assessment 


## Statement of Problem
To proceed  to the next stage of the interview process, candidates must build pixel-perfect replica of screens in the Figma file.  
Figma file: https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.figma.com/file/ZKILoCoIoy1IESdBpq3GNC/Frontend&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1719067659927449&usg=AOvVaw08kIXoxBzrKZ_Gkvm9jM8H/


## Goals/Objectives
1. Screens to build
    - Login
    - Dashboard (key components include Sidebar, Navbar)
    - Users
    - User details
2. The user pages should pull data from a mock api with 500 records
3. Make use of localStorage  to store and retrieve user details on the user details page.
4. Ensure screens are mobile responsive
5. Some details are intentionally left out of this instruction set. Details I focused on seeing primary focus is on the users and user details pages were
    - Sorting by columns (ascending and descending order)
    - Filter functionalities
    - User details tabs
6. Unit testing with positive and negative scenarios


## Stack Used
* React
* Typescript
* SCSS

The above were used according to the stack currently being used at Lendsqr.
Using React, TypeScript, and SCSS together provides a powerful framework for building modern web applications that are scalable, maintainable, and efficient. The strengths of each technology complements the others to deliver a robust development experience and high-quality end products.
